The Snake game is a classic example of a simple 2D grid-based game. Here's a theoretical algorithm for a basic Snake game:

Initialize the Game:
Set up a grid with a specified size (e.g., 10x10).
Place the snake on the grid with an initial length (e.g., 3) and a starting position.
Place the food at a random empty position on the grid.

Game Loop:
Enter a loop that continues until the game is over.
In each iteration:
Update the snake's position based on its current direction.
Check for collisions with the walls, itself, or the food.
If the snake collides with the food, increase its length and place a new food at a random position.
If the snake collides with the walls or itself, end the game.

User Input:
Capture user input to change the snake's direction.
The direction determines how the snake will move in the next iteration.
Update Display:

Display the current state of the game grid, showing the snake, food, and any other relevant information.

Collision Detection:
Check for collisions at each iteration:
Wall Collision: If the snake's head goes beyond the grid boundaries, end the game.
Self-Collision: If the snake's head collides with its body, end the game.
Food Collision: If the snake's head overlaps with the food, increase the snake's length and place a new food.

Game Over:
Display a game-over message.
Allow the option to restart the game.
This is a high-level algorithm, and the actual implementation details will depend on the programming language and platform you are using. 
You'll need to implement functions for updating the snake, handling user input, collision detection, and rendering the game on the screen. 
Additionally, you may want to add features like score tracking and difficulty levels to enhance the gameplay.
